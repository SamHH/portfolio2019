          <strong>Software Engineer</strong>&nbsp;Hi there! I'm a software
          engineer based in London, working remotely, with a passion for pure
          functional programming.

          I've been writing code professionally for{" "}
          {formatDistanceToNow(overallStart)} now. If you'd like to see what
          open source software I work on in my free time, check out my software

        </p>

        <p>
          In my current position at Adaptavist, in the ScriptRunner Cloud team,
          I've been pioneering a number of frontend and serverless initiatives.
          These range from refactoring everything into strict, functional
          TypeScript, to encouraging us towards better testing practices,
          introducing property-based testing and page-level integration testing.
          A major redesign of a parser core to our business is currently
          planned, to which end I've written a greenlit prototype in Haskell in
          the style of a recursive descent parser.

            <p>
              I care deeply about writing business logic and applications more
              broadly in the safest, most maintainable manner possible. I
              leverage the type system to encode logical invariants and
              eradicate certain classes of bugs. I write testable code and write
              good tests for that code, emphasising quality of tests over
              chasing potentially worse-than-useless coverage targets. Whilst it
              can be taken to an extreme, I do believe's there's truth in the
              idea of "self-documenting code". Where that isn't possible, I
              write concise, helpful documentation, planning for the long-term.
              I use tooling like Git effectively, including leaving a
              semantically meaningful, atomic commit log behind.

              My career thus far has been dominated by the web and particularly
              thereof the frontend. Early on in my career I specialised somewhat
              in CSS, though I've since heavily shifted towards programming
              itself so to speak. I've retained that hard-fought understanding
              of CSS. I've been writing and utilising APIs throughout, be they
              more traditional or in the form of microservices. I can
              comfortably interact with the DOM manually but would sooner reach
              for a reactive abstraction.

            <p>
              I spend a significant proportion of my free time learning, and I
              enjoy sharing that knowledge with others; I routinely pair with
              colleagues and help them through challenges. This is a very large
              part of what drives me on a daily basis.

                I've been working permanently remotely since 2018. The
                flexibility suits me given my self-driven nature.

              <p>
                I've built my own computer and run Arch Linux on it. This is the
                machine on which I do all my work, professional and personal,
                and everything else; there is a meaningful productivity gain for
                me here both in the power of the hardware and the
                configurability of the software.

                Sometimes my cat likes to join me when I'm programming. He is an
                invaluable source of inspiration and unintended keystrokes.
